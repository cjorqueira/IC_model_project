Disney+ is a subscription-based streaming service owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company. Launched in November 2019, Disney+ offers a vast library of movies, TV shows, and original content from Disney's extensive collection. This includes beloved classics, new releases, and exclusive original programming from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic.
Disney + is a type of O2 Extras that  you can choose whether you’re new customer to the company or upgrading, you can get up to 6 months of Disney+ Standard plan.
Our goal is to predict customers with a propensity to lapse onto a paid version and keep paying for at least 2 months .
This model was developed to support campaigns like
⦁Thank you campaign
-	Will allow us to test the model to see if we can drive the same uptake with a smaller audience, to prevent over-contacting customers who are unlikely to take up the offer.
-	It will also allow low propensity customers to be picked up in other more relevant campaigns.
BAU (i.e NWR)
⦁	NWR (New World Retention) is going through redevelopment at the moment. We have asked to include the Disney+ model to allow us to present different modules within comms to customers. We will need to do some testing, for example, understand if we should be presenting Disney content to high propensity customers, OR if there is an incremental benefit to promoting to those who score lower on the model.
What’s the problem we’re solving? 
⦁	Optimising Extras business opportunities and applying a Machine learning model design can drive the subscribers’ growth, improve our campaign targeting, indirectly reduce churn and bring more profits to the business.
⦁	Increasing conversion of O2 Extras to AUTO ENROL represents a commercial opportunity to drive conversion rates up and offer customers more value for money, increasing customer satisfaction and NPS scores.
